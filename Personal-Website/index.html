                            These concepts are fundamental to computer science and software engineering, and I learn how to implement and analyze data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees and graphs, and algorithms like sorting, searching and recursion. 
                            This provides a solid foundation for my further studies and helps me develop problem-solving skills essential for software development. I am trying to do at least one leetcode question per day.

                                            A highlight of the application is its integration of the OpenAI API for intelligent scheduling. OpenAI's NLP processes user inputs to generate personalized schedules, considering task priorities, deadlines, and optimal time allocations. Security features include end-to-end encryption and IAM for access control.

                                            This mobile application, developed with React Native and Expo Go maps, elevates the scavenger hunt experience. Its cross-platform capability ensures accessibility for both iOS and Android users, while real-time location tracking and a coordinate-based rewards system add a dynamic layer to the adventure. 
                                            Originally conceived as a replacement for the university's orientation app, the user-friendly interface and gamification elements enhance engagement. 
                                            The technological synergy of React Native and Expo Go maps not only provides visual appeal but also facilitates efficient development. 
                                            Future plans may involve social integration for collaborative experiences and advanced analytics for insights, making it a comprehensive and forward-thinking solution for interactive location-based challenges.

                    I had the opportunity to participate in the Schulich Engineering Competition hosted by the University of Calgary. We competed in the category of "Competitive Programming." For this competition, we were tasked with creating an algorithm for a local airport to minimize the number of gates used. 
                    
                    We completed this competition in under 6 hours, during which we also developed a user interface for the staff/client side. By the end of the competition, we were placed first out of 4 other teams.

                    The Western Engineering Competition (WEC) is a conference where Western universities participate to challenge themselves and compare to other universities. We competed in the "Programming" category. 
                    In this competition, we were tasked to create an application to support people in the category of accessibility and independence. My team and I created a web application that utilizes OpenAI to generate tailored, specific schedules depending on who the user is. 
                    This schedule is generated as 9-5, providing activities to improve the daily lives of the user. Alongside that, this application is deployable as we used Amazon Web Services (AWS) for our back end. At the end of the competition, we were only able to secure the 4th position out of 10 other universities.

                    Collaboration between the Digital Engineering Student Society (DESS), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the Schulich Ignite Hackathon resulted in the creation of an interactive scavenger hunt app. 
                    Our team successfully developed a mobile application that tracked users in real-time, allowing them to earn points by reaching specific locations. 
                    As a result of our efforts, we secured the 1st place in this competition.
