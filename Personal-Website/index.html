                            As of right now, I am working on my own side projects. 
                            I am particularly interested in learning about large language models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. 
                            These topics really fascinate me, especially in the context of AI.

                                            This web application was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary purpose of the application is to gather information on whether or not people are interested in a new drink product. 
                                            The frontend of the application is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, ensuring a smooth experience for visitors as they interact with the form and submit their details.
                                        </p>
                                        For data collection and storage, I utilized Google Firebase as the backend. Firebase provides a robust and scalable platform for storing customer information securely. It also offers real-time database capabilities, which ensures that the data is updated instantly as users submit their responses. 
                                        This integration with Firebase allows for efficient handling and retrieval of data, which is essential for analyzing customer interest and feedback effectively.

                                        </p>
                                        To make the web application accessible to users, I deployed it using Netlify. 
                                        Netlify is a powerful platform that simplifies the process of deploying web applications by providing continuous deployment from GitHub repositories. 
                                        This ensures that any updates or changes to the application are automatically deployed, keeping the site current and reducing manual deployment efforts. By leveraging Netlify's capabilities, the web application is hosted reliably, with fast load times and high availability.

                                            This web application seamlessly combines JavaScript and React on the frontend with Python and AWS on the backend to offer users an intuitive scheduling tool within a 9-5 workday framework. The React-based frontend ensures a user-friendly experience, gathering preferences through interactive forms. AWS Lambda and a scalable database handle backend operations efficiently.

                                            A highlight of the application is its integration of the OpenAI API for intelligent scheduling. OpenAI's NLP processes user inputs to generate personalized schedules, considering task priorities, deadlines, and optimal time allocations. Security features include end-to-end encryption and IAM for access control.

                                        </p>

                                            Future plans may involve machine learning integration and collaboration features, enhancing the application's capabilities. Overall, this web application provides a streamlined solution for efficient daily planning, combining frontend elegance, backend robustness, and AI-driven intelligence.

                                            I took on a key role in implementing and coding using C++ for the Arduino board, specifically focusing on adjusting distance parameters and sensor settings for the parking sensor prototype. 
                                            Additionally, I was tasked with examining revenue projections for potential upscaling of the prototype. This dual responsibility involved not only fine-tuning technical aspects but also considering the broader business perspective, aiming for a well-rounded contribution to the project's success.
                                        </p>
                                        </p>
                                            As we approached the project's conclusion, a crucial milestone awaited us — the presentation to a panel of judges with significant entrepreneurial experiences. 
                                            Our task involved presenting and defending our prototype, subjecting it to their careful evaluation. The judges not only assessed the technical aspects but also simulated whether they would choose to invest in our product. 
                                            This phase served as a challenging yet insightful moment, providing valuable feedback and testing our ability to articulate the market potential of our innovation in the eyes of seasoned entrepreneurs.

                    The Western Engineering Competition (WEC) is a conference where Western universities participate to challenge themselves and compare to other universities. We competed in the "Programming" category. 
                    In this competition, we were tasked to create an application to support people in the category of accessibility and independence. My team and I created a web application that utilizes OpenAI to generate tailored, specific schedules depending on who the user is. 
                    This schedule is generated as 9-5, providing activities to improve the daily lives of the user. Alongside that, this application is deployable as we used Amazon Web Services (AWS) for our back end. At the end of the competition, we were only able to secure the 4th position out of 10 other universities.

                        Developed an application that converts LAS files from to be properly formatted in with the proper requirements. 
                        This was done by importing the LAS files, converting to text, extracting the data into JSON format, and then modifying its values to be in the correct format. 
                        Using Python, I was able to create a script that would automate this process and then properly adjust with unit tests.

                        I was responsible for updating and optimizing the ArcGIS software for the company. My primary task involved utilizing the ArcGIS Online API to retrieve various geospatial data sets essential for the company’s operations. 
                        Once the data was retrieved, I employed a series of manipulation and transformation techniques to ensure the data was in the correct format and structure required by our internal systems.
    
                        These manipulations ensured that the data was accurate, up-to-date, and suitable for integration into the company's proprietary software.
    
                        After the data was thoroughly processed and validated, it was then uploaded into the company's in-house software. This custom-built software was designed to handle complex geospatial data and provide the necessary tools and features for our team to perform their tasks efficiently. 
                        By ensuring seamless integration and optimizing the data flow between ArcGIS and our internal systems, I significantly improved the overall efficiency and accuracy of our geospatial data management processes.
